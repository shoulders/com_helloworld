# Piece of Software!
This is my reference component that i use to build my other extensions with and is based on the work by robbie Jackson (and others) in the joomla mvs component article.
I have mades ome imnporvements/modificatiosn to it as aoutlined below and also hope to add my demo features as rewuired. I have also made notes of issues and fixed Robbie suggested.
The whole cources of videos alone took me nearly a week and are very indepths. They are useful not just for the tutorial but for a reference to joomla and how it works. alot of the information will apply to Joomla 4. You do have to build up the component yourt self to get the final version. up to step 26 were built by .... it would be nice if he fidnshed the job or someone submitted the final parts.
